<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Swift](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [SceneKit](https://getbootstrap.com)

<!-- Git Flow -->
## Git Flow

## Add new Feature or fix a Bug

1. Create your Feature or Fix Branch
  * `git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`
  * `git checkout -b fix/AmazingFix`
2. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
  * `git commit -m 'Feature(AmazingFeature): Add some AmazingFeature`
  * `git commit -m 'Fix(AmazingFix): Fixes a bug`
3. Push to the Branch
  * `git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`
  * `git push origin fix/AmazingFix`
4. Open a Pull Request in Github's Pull request tab and fill it with the above Pull Request Template.
5. If the Pull Request is not able to merge automatically do the following steps while on your branch:
```sh
git pull develop
```
6. Solves conflicts in Xcode, and commit your changes
7. Add reviewers to your Pull Request and wait for approval.
